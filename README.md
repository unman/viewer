# viewer

Basic network viewer, using networkx, and stripped networkx_viewer  
Use on management qube  
Displays Qubes network configuration  


`pd.read_csv` gives strange results for naming columns (ordering) - why?

TBD: Remove nulls - they are weighting the display badly and confuse - why is 'None' treated as a node?  
TBD: remove templates (highlight any online ?)  
TBD: node colour by label  
TBD: action menus
